In this lab, we accumulate data about heartbeat fluctuations, using circuits, and read it, using an LED. The heartbeat data is called an input signal, and the LED light is called an output signal.\n",

To capture these fluctuations, you are going to use a combination of an ambient light sensor and a potentiometer as your **receiver**.\n",

In the second half of the circuit, we use $C_3$ to filter out noise that is above the frequency of a normal heartbeat, around 8Hz or 480bpm (how we calculate these frequencies is out of scope for this class but covered in 16B). Still, our newly amplified signal is inpercievable to the human eye. To amplify this difference further, we pass our signal through another inverting amplifier with gain $A_v = -\\frac{R_6}{R_5}$ (note that this re-inverts our signal). Effectively, our original signal is amplified by a total of $\\frac{R_3R_6}{R_5}$ from both inverting amplifiers, allowing us to see the LED turn on when a pulse is detected and turn off when there is no pulse."
